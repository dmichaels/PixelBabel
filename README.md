- performance-work-related-to-dynamic-resizing-20250510
  Latest development circa April/May/June 2025.
  First branch/version where all of the arithmetic is right for shifting and resizing.
  This has morphed into work on a generic cell-grid-view based set of functionality to be
  resused in any cell based app, e.g. Conway's Game of Life; PixelBabel classic, et cetera.
  Merged to main on 2025-05-30

  Latest development. Starting actual implementation of Game of Life in more detail now that
  the basics the the CellGrid stuff is in pretty good shape.
